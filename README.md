This is a study project to gain experience with ai models using only pre-trained models. 

The main idea is to not start from scratch over and over again, and to build the datasets, 
it is okay for projects which have no sufficient datasets, but to gain experience in using 
other peoples models. And also one goal is to get good at it, doing these usecases 
end-to-end
