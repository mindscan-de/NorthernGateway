# NorthernGateway

This is a study project to gain experience with ai models using only pre-trained models. 

The main idea is to not start from scratch over and over again, and to build the datasets, 
it is okay for projects which have no sufficient datasets, but to gain experience in using 
other peoples models. And also one goal is to get good at it, doing these usecases 
end-to-end

# Rules

Each Project starts with a new folder. Each project shall have a short/small project description,
it should state, which datasets will be used and what the MVP will be. Sometimes there will be
architecture documentation alongside. These are Projects which are implementable in up to 3 
days - and then forget about them and move on. This is mainly to learn to focus on the things
which matter in a project and its execution until it runs. It is also to create a minimal documentation
and a minimal requirements document - so this is about whole project development but in a 
timeboxed fashion and develop the MVP as fast as possible.
