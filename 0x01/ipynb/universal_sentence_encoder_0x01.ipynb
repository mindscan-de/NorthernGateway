    "* since language learning is always about being good enough\n",
    "* research:\n",
    "  * if not, we would analyze the encoding vector, and maybe analyze the difference of the feature vector, like, pasttense and other stuff.\n",
    "  * these vectors might be calculated by the native languages and then stored into a small database and therefore help the student to catch mistakes he made while translating\n",
    "* also give the student text so that he can translate that sentence into his native laguage\n",
    "* other language programs always want an exact translation and it is about memorizing instead of approximatnig the aquisition of a language"
